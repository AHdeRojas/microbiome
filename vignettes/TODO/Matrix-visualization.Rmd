### Matrix visualization

Matrix heatmaps:

```{r matvisu-example, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
library(microbiome)

data.directory <- system.file("extdata", package = "microbiome")

genus.matrix.log10.simulated <- read.profiling(level = "L2", method = "frpa", 
			              data.dir = data.directory, log10 = TRUE)  

tmp <- netresponse::plot_matrix(genus.matrix.log10.simulated, type = "twoway")
```


Project high-dimensional data on two-dimensional plane by various methods 
including PCA, MDS, Sammons mapping etc. (for visualization purposes):

* project.data
