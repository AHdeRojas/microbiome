### Relative abundancies

Estimate relative abundance of the taxa in each sample. Note: the
input data set needs to be in absolute scale (not logarithmic).

```{r diversity-example6, fig.path = "figure/"}
library(microbiome)
pseq <- download_microbiome("dietswap")

# Pick sample subset
pseq <- subset_samples(pseq, group == "DI" & nationality == "AFR")

# Plot absolute taxon abundances
plot_abundance(pseq, relative.abundance = FALSE, taxonomic.level = "Phylum")

# Plot relative taxon abundances
plot_abundance(pseq, relative.abundance = TRUE, taxonomic.level = "Phylum")
```
