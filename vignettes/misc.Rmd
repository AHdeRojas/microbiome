# Pick the OTU data
# (note the zero point has been moved to the detection;
#  typically signal 1.8 at HITChip log10 scale)
# otu <- abundances(pseq)

# Determine detection at the 0.15 quantile
# Then Calculate richness.
# This simply indicates how many taxa are present in each sample
# (exceed the detection). This measure is sometimes used with
# phylogenetic microarrays.
# det.th <- quantile(otu, 0.15)
