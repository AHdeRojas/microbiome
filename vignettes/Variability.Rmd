### Stability analysis in time

Calculate correlations between time points 1 and 2 for each subject,
then calculate stability as the average correlation of these
subject-specific correlations. Done as above, but instead of one
matrix, give two matrices as input. These are phylotypes vs. samples
matrices and correspond to time points 1 and 2, respectively. The rows
(phylotypes) and columns (subjects) should be in the same order in
both matrices.
