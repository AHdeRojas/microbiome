### Variability analysis within group of samples

Calculate variability as the average correlation between samples and their mean for a given phylotypes vs. samples matrix:

```{r stability-example, message=FALSE}
# Example data
library(microbiome)
data(peerj32)
x <- peerj32$microbes

# Estimate Stability
stability <- estimate_variability(t(x))$stability
```

### Stability analysis in time

Calculate correlations between time points 1 and 2 for each subject,
then calculate stability as the average correlation of these
subject-specific correlations. Done as above, but instead of one
matrix, give two matrices as input. These are phylotypes vs. samples
matrices and correspond to time points 1 and 2, respectively. The rows
(phylotypes) and columns (subjects) should be in the same order in
both matrices.
