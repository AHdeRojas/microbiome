### Continuous variables

Quantify continuous associations with lm_phyloseq function. This uses
the limma model to generate a table of P-values and effect sizes. Note
that no confounding variables taken into account in this wrapper. See
the [limma homepage](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limma/) for more
detailed analyses.

```{r limma-lm-phyloseq, warning=FALSE, fig.path = "figure/"}
data("atlas1006")
# Pick RBB extracted samples (r) and baseline time point
pseq <- subset_samples(atlas1006, DNA_extraction_method == "r" & time == 0)
source(system.file("extdata/lm_phyloseq.R", package = "microbiome"))
tab <- lm_phyloseq(pseq, "age")
kable(head(tab), digits = 3)
```
