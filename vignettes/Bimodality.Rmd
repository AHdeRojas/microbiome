## Bimodality quantification

Calculate coefficients of bimodality (used in [Shade et
al.](http://mbio.asm.org/content/5/4/e01371-14)) for taxa in an
example data set, and plot the taxa with the lowest and highest score:

```{r bimodality, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.path = "figure/"}
# Load example data
library(microbiome)
data(peerj32); 
mydata <- t(peerj32$microbes)

# Calculate coefficient of bimodality for each taxa
bs <- apply(mydata, 1, coefficient.of.bimodality)

# Pick the most and least bimodal taxa as examples
unimodal <- names(which.min(bs))
bimodal <- names(which.max(bs))

# Visualize
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(density(mydata[unimodal,]), main = unimodal)
plot(density(mydata[bimodal,]), main = bimodal)
```
