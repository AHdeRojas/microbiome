### Abundance histograms

Different sample sets have different population distributions in
microbial abundance. It is also important to consider whether to use
absolute or logarithmic abundances.


```{r hist, fig.width=16, fig.heigth=8, fig.path = "figure/"}
library(microbiome)
x <- download_microbiome("atlas1006")

# Pick the subset of RBB-preprocessed samples from time point 0
x <- subset_samples(x, time == 0 & DNA_extraction_method == "r")

# Pick only specific taxa
tax <- "Bifidobacterium"
x <- prune_taxa(tax, x)

# Visualize population densities
# TODO: phyloseq routines will be added later
d <- as.vector(otu_table(x))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(density(d), main = paste(tax, "Abs."), xlab = "Abundance (Absolute HITChip signal)")
plot(density(log10(d)), main = paste(tax, "Log10"), xlab = "Abundance (Log10 HITChip signal)")
```
