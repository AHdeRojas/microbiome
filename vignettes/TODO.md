### TODO

 * ztrans heatmap into plot_composition function
 * tipping element heatmap

 * stability line plot

 * Microbiota maturity index? Has previously been shown to differentiate between healthy children and those with health issues. Was calculated as the first principal coordinate from a PCoA using only significantly age-associated genus-level taxa in the control and early-life groups.

 * neatmap utilities from phyloseq

 * Negative binomial for sample comparisons

 * gower distance for sample similarities

 * pairwise comparisons with subject random effec term

 * classification of the taxa into the distinct abundance types

 * SPIEC-EASE / SparCC network algorithms from the huge package

 * Bagged and ordinary RDA for phyloseq objects with ggplot visualizations
