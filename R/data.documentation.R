#' peerj32 data documentation

#' The peerj32 data set contains high-through profiling data from 
#' 389 human blood serum lipids and 130 intestinal genus-level bacteria from 
#' 44 samples (22 subjects from 2 time points; before and after 
#' probiotic/placebo intervention). The data set can be used to investigate 
#' associations between intestinal bacteria and host lipid metabolism.
