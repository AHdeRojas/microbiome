\title{ANCOM Test for Abundance Differences}
\usage{
ancom(x, varname, multcorr_type = 2, sig = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{phyloseq-class}}}

\item{varname}{Name of the metadata variable to be used for grouping}

\item{multcorr_type}{takes value 1 (stringent correction on the full pairwise matrix), OR 2 (within OTU/taxa multiple correction), OR 3 (no correction).}

\item{sig}{significance level (default 0.05)}
}
\value{
Vector of adjusted p-values, one for each taxon.
}
\description{
Perform ANCOM test on phyloseq data.

\details{
This function is directly modified from Weiss et al. (2017). The R code was obtained from the first author and included with permission in the microbiome package. For reference to the original ANCOM method by Mandal et al. (2015).
