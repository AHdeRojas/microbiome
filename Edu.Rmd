# Differential abundance: univariate case

  - Univariate examples: Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, t-test
  
  - Standard linear model including covariates
  
  - Extra: mixed models
  
  - Extra: Generalized linear models (glmulti package for instance),


# Differential abundance: multivariate case


## PERMANOVA




## Pooled analyses of individual taxa
  - Multiple testing
  - Multivariate case: DESeq2, pros & cons
    sparsity, counts, long tails, overdispersion


# Unimodality vs. bi/multimodality

How this may affect the results in the above tests

How to quantify


# Dirichlet Mixture Model (DMM) 

- Clustering

- Nonparametric models
